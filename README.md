# dotfiles

My dotfiles and scripts.
You might find something useful here. Probably not.


Scripts are in bin/ and contain a lot of old nonsense. Many need rewriting from scratch.

Most my .dotfiles are fairly generic.

There is also a mess of stuff in bash-aliases. Some useful stuff, a lot of rubbish too.
